<h2>System Introduction:</h1>
<h3>Context -</h3>
<p>The National Park Service History Electronic Archive was created by Dr. Harry A. Butowsky (r.i.p. May 2023) and an unnamed volunteer, and was published in October of 2013. Notably, the creation of this information system was, and remains, un-affiliated with the National Park Service's operations, and therefore it is not a federal entity. The domain name for this information system is: NPSHistory.com </p>
<h3>Users -</h3>
<p>NPSHistory.com exists as a learning resource for the general public, but was namely created for National Parks Service enthusiasts and employees. Users of this information system are welcomed to perform exploratory and casual research. The authors give a disclaimer to users on the "About Us" page that reads:</p>
<p style="font-style:italic;color:DarkGreen;">"While most of the content contained herein is in the public domain, the Website also contains copyrighted works (permission to host this content has been obtained from the copyright-holders); please respect these copyright-holders by merely linking to this content and not re-posting. Use of this Website is done so at your own risk; we are not responsible for any loss or damage arising from information or links contained within this site."</p>
<h3>Content -</h3>
<p>According to their "Site Map", there are two major categories of content: "NPS Archives" and "Park Archives." Each of these categories contain four or five sub-categories of proprietary subject-headings, and some of those with even further divisions. The wide variety of types of digitized objects include:</p>
<ul>
  <li>guidebooks</li>
  <li>annual reports</li>
  <li>periodicals</li>
  <li>brochures</li>
  <li>handbooks</li>
  <li>studies</li>
  <li>pieces of legislation</li>
  <li>posters</li>
</ul>
<h2>Discussion of the System:</h2>
<h3>Identified Design Features -</h3>
<p>There are minimal opportunities for interpersonal computing beyond the user being able to click through the hierarchy of subject headings and quick links to the e-resources. There are no widgets, save for a Google-operated website search bar at the bottom of the home page, nor are there any Web 2.0 technologies. The overall impression of the website is very readable and content-rich with tasteful use of colors and page-heading photographs.</p>
<h3>Pros and Cons -</h3>
<table>
  <tr>
    <th style="font-weight:bold;">Pros</th>
    <th style="font-weight:bold;">Cons</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>easy to navigate</td>
    <td>younger generations of web users may loose interest in the interface</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>consistent font types and colors</td>
    <td>text size can be a bit small</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>efficiently organized, clickable hierarchy</td>
    <td>the search bar is operated by Google and discretely located at the bottom of the home page</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>minimal error of organization</td>
    <td>the metadata of each item does not appear tagged and is not filterable by facets</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>easy to explore previously unthought-of content</td>
    <td>no Web 2.0 technology</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<h3>Suggestions for Improvement -</h3>
<p>Though the content of this digital repository is volume-rich and well categorized by proprietary subject headings, this site could be modernized. Perhaps a fourth navigation link in the navigation bar at the top of the page could be named "Metadata Search" and be linked to a new page in the website that utilizes the metadata of the items in the collection. On this page could be a key word or advanced search bar as well as filterable facets to group items by their metadata (ie. date published, author, subject, genre, audience). A very advanced feature on this page could be an artificially intelligent chat bot that analyzes the content of all of the items in the collection and operates as a reference librarian.</p>
<p>That being said, I do find the National Park Service History Electronic Library & Archive to be highly engaging for someone who appreciates content-rich material on the national parks!</p>
