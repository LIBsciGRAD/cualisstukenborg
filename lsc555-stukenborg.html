		<h1>"Smashed English Muffin Breakfast Sandwich"</h1>
		<h3>"Prep-Ahead Breakfast with Eggs and Seasonal Veggies"</h3>
		<a href="https://www.fitnessblender.com/articles/smashed-english-muffin-breakfast-sandwich-prep-ahead-breakfast-with-eggs-and-seasonal-veggies">recipe from fitnessBLENDER.com</a>
		<h2>The Dish</h2>
		<p>This super simple breakfast sandwich is not only easy to make but it also contains a lot of good-for-you ingredients. Egg whites, broccoli, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, and fresh basil make up the bulk of the egg cup base, providing a hearty serving of lean protein and vegetables. The egg cups are baked using a muffin pan, perfect for portion control. The egg cups are also a meal prepper's dream; they can be made well in advance, frozen or refrigerated, and reheated when ready to enjoy.</p>
		<h2>Prepping Ahead/Time Saving Tips</h2>
		<p>The egg cups can be made a day or two in advance, cooked, chilled, and refrigerated until you’re ready to assemble the sandwiches. You can also freeze the cups after they’ve been cooked, thawing and reheating when, or as, needed. You can reheat the egg cups by either microwaving them or baking them in a preheated oven until warmed through.</p>

		<h2>Preparation Instructions</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Preheat oven to 400°F or 200°C and lightly grease a muffin pan with pan release spray.</li>
			<li>Place egg whites, broccoli, zucchini, yellow squash, red bell pepper, basil, and half of the mozzarella (1/2oz. or 14g) in a medium bowl. Lightly season with salt and pepper and whisk to combine.</li>
			<li>Pour the mixture into the prepared muffin pan, filling either 1 large muffin cup or 2 medium-sized muffin cups.</li>
			<li>Bake for 10-15 minutes or until the egg cups are cooked through. Remove from the oven and set aside to rest for 5 minutes before removing the egg cups from the muffin pan.</li>
			<li>Lightly spritz the split English muffin with pan-release spray and sprinkle each half with the remaining mozzarella cheese.</li>
			<li>Place the prepped English muffin on a baking sheet and place in the oven; toast for 2-3 minutes or until the muffin is lightly golden and the cheese has melted.</li>
			<li>Remove from the oven, place a warm egg cup in the center of one of the toasted muffin halves, top with the other muffin half, and, using your hands, press the sandwich together. Serve warm.</li>
