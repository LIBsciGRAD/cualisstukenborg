<h3>STEP 2 - Heuristic Critique of cuatower.com in the context of an undergraduate professor’s lesson plan.</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;">
<b>Undergraduate Professor’s Lesson Plan:</b>
<br><br>
<i>Activity:</i>
<br><br>
Students must: <b>(1)</b> select three articles relevant to “Current Crime at the Catholic University of America” from the Catholic University of America’s The Tower Independent Newspaper website, <b>(2)</b> describe the evaluative techniques they employed to select these three articles (ie. instead of other articles), <b>(3)</b> write a non-biased thesis statement on crime at the Catholic University of America based on the three selected articles.
<br><br>
<i>Professor’s Goals:</i>
<br><br>
1) Incorporate original source material on current crime at the Catholic University of America into the lesson plan and student learning activity.
<br><br>
2) Encourage students to conduct evaluative research and find the most appropriate sources for their work on their own.
<br><br>
3) Introduce students to The Tower webpage (cuatower.com) and allow them to navigate it independently.
<br><br>
<i>Student’s Goals:</i>
<br><br>
1) Find and obtain source material that most closely associates with the professor-selected topic of “crime at the Catholic University of America”
<br><br>
2) Identify and employ evaluative techniques towards the search results of articles on cuatower.com.
<br><br>
3) Formulate a thesis statement based on the content of three selected articles.
<br><br>
<br>
<b>Critique according to Nielson’s (1995) Ten Usability Heuristics:<sup>1</sup></b>
<br><br>
<i><u>1. Visibility of system status</u></i> – (Keep users informed; Ex. progress bar, status alert, etc.)
<br><br>
Search results appear very rapidly. The rapid response time of the web pages does not necessitate a means to keep users informed of progress or status. This is an encouraging feature of the site, as many researchers want to find their sources as quickly as possible. The students in this activity looking for articles should not have to worry about system status.
<br><br>
<i><u>2. Match between system and the real world</u></i> – (Speak users’ language; Ex. menu labels, help tips, etc.)
<br><br>
It is easy to see how the heading of the website, which appears on all of the webpages (ie. “The Tower: Catholic University’s Independent Newspaper, Est. 1922”), is formatted in such a way that it mimics what the title of the physical print edition looks like. Just below this heading is the navigation bar that includes tabs of headings that are likely to match the section headings of the print edition (ie. “Arts & Entertainment,” “Sports,” “Crosswords & Comics”). This organization is very user friendly and navigable. Students could likely click on “News” in the navigation bar to find articles on crime at the Catholic University of America.
<br><br>
<i><u>3. User control and freedom</u></i> – (User should have a way out from an unwanted situation; Ex. undo, redo, “home,” etc.)
<br><br>
There are no navigation buttons embedded within the website, but when a search is inputted, or when a months and year within the archive or tag or specific date is clicked, there is a hyperlinked page tree at the top of the page that the user can easily see where they are within the site and easily click on a higher branch of the tree to navigate back to a higher tier of the website.
<br><br>
<i><u>4. Consistency and standards</u></i> – (Help user learn the system; No need to wonder around finding the right function)
<br><br>
The webpage is fairly intuitive to a general audience familiar with basic internet usage. There is no abundance of technical jargon that would confuse amateurs. The undergraduate students, likely being introduced to this website for the first time, should be able to navigate and identify sections of the website with ease.
<br><br>
<i><u>5. Error prevention</u></i> – (Error correction, correction suggestions; Confirmation)
<br><br>
While (as will be shown in heuristic #9) the system clearly indicates when there is a search error, this system does little to provide corrections suggestions. For example, if a student’s keyword search yielded no results, it may be helpful for the system to suggest the correct spelling of a term if the spelling was incorrect, or other common, related keywords that are actually found in the resources.
<br><br>
<i><u>6. Recognition rather than recall</u></i> – (Minimize users’ memory load; Make objects, options, actions of the system visible)
<br><br>
Every hyperlinked text changes font color (and the navigation bar items become underlined) when the cursor rolls over the hyperlinked text. Whenever the cursor rolls over a hyperlinked item (inclusive of article images that hyperlink to the article), the cursor icon changes from a pointer to a pointing hand. These visual changes are very helpful for the user to understand what items are clickable. In the example of this lesson plan, students can visually see that the red tags overlaying article images (ex. “Crime Blotters”) are hyperlinked. The students can infer that clicking these tags must lead them to a webpage with all articles relating to that tag.
<br><br>
<i><u>7. Flexibility and efficiency of use</u></i> – (Reduce the interaction; Provide shortcuts; Customization for frequent actions)
<br><br>
There are two search bars for the user to input the topics they are seeking. Students of this professor’s lesson plan could easily input the keyword “crime” into one of the two search bars as a way to begin their discovery of appropriate articles.
<br><br>
<i><u>8. Aesthetic and minimalist design</u></i> – (No need to contain irrelevant information; Minimize the units of information)
<br><br>
The displayed information on the website is mostly minimized, yet there are a few areas that could be improved aesthetically. For example, the right-hand pane of the list of months for the archive could be split into two or more columns instead of simply one column extending down the length of the web page. This right-hand pane also conflicts with the matching website footnote pane of the same list of archival months of the newspaper.
<br><br>
<i><u>9. Help users recognize, diagnose, and recover from errors</u></i> – (Provide good error messages to guide users, Indication of problem and solution)
<br><br>
The webpage display for a search result error is very appropriate, guiding, and even considerate or polite. For example, when the word “toads” is entered into a search bar, the resulting page is titled “Nothing Found” and contains the following text in the body of the webpage: “Sorry, but nothing matched your search terms. Please try again with some different keywords.” Just below that text is a search bar on the page, encouraging users to conduct another search. This clearly instructs the student to use other keywords than what they just entered into the search bar.
<br><br>
<i><u>10. Help and documentation</u></i> – (Provide help and documentation for self-training; Ex. “Help” page, FAQs, help information at each stages of actions)
<br><br>
With this system there are no help, FAQ, or Q&A pages, but there is an “Meet the Staff” page that gives profile images and contact information for the editors of the newspaper, which is the closest opportunity for the user to acquire documentation.

<h3>STEP 3 - Summary of PART 1 assessment, with the top 2 strengths and top 2 weaknesses of the system. Explain your assessment. Provide a few screenshots as appropriate to illustrate your summary.</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;">Overall, cuatower.com scores subjectively well when evaluated by Nielson’s Ten Usability Heuristics. The website easily accomplishes for the user the services it advertises to accomplish, namely, to help the user find relevant articles from the CUA’s independent newspaper: The Tower. The website is well-designed, minus a few aesthetical errors and negligence of universal design characteristics.
</p>

<table>
<tr>
<td><b>Strength 1:</b></td>
<td><u><i>The website is, over-all, well designed.</i></u> There is a rapid response time to click inputs. There are minimal HCI’s that occur in order for the information seeker to achieve their intended task. The only colors employed in the design are a few shades of grey, a canary-like yellow, and a cardinal-like red. The text layout is readable, clear, and consistent. Page trees are generated when a user navigates away from the home page, allowing for ease of navigation. Graphics are well distributed and scaled. Each article contains at least one image, either an article-specific or subject-specific image. Text and block components are consistently formatted, spaced, and sized.

</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Strength 2:</b></td>
<td><u><i>The employment of tags yields convenient discovery of related articles for users.</i></u> Tags are attributed to the articles by content-related subjects and by the section of the newspaper to which the article belongs. When a tag (red button with the name of the tag) is clicked, a new page is loaded with all articles linked to that tag.</td>
<td><img src="https://libscigrad.github.io/cualisstukenborg/LSC%20555,%20Assignment%202,%20S2.jpg" width="500px"></td>
</tr>
	<tr>
<td><b>Weakness 1:</b></td>
<td><u><i>Several details could be improved aesthetically.</i></u> For example, on many, if not all, of the pages besides the home page, there are currently two “Archives” lists visible that span through the years of issues available on the website (September 2015). This is unnecessarily redundant and makes for an unusually long web-page with empty, unused space.</td>
<td><img src="https://libscigrad.github.io/cualisstukenborg/LSC%20555,%20Assignment%202,%20W1.jpg" width="500px"></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><b>Weakness 2:</b></td>
<td><u><i>Documentation is missing.</i></u> There is little to no information about what The Tower publication is, beyond an X post on the “About” page–which only contains the X post. There is an indication of copyright within the footer of the website, but no date is attributed to the copyright. There are no security/policy/use policies. Usability is limited to english-speaking users.</td>

<h2>PART 2 - A “mini-usability test”:</h2>

<h3>STEP 4 - Questionnaire and Observation Form.</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;">
Submitted separately to protect participant information.
</p>

<h3>STEP 5 - Comparison between heuristic analysis (PART 1) and mini-usability test (PART 2), as well as some suggestions for improvement.</h3>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;">
Most notably, <u><i>the usability test was completed much more efficiently than the heuristic evaluation.</i></u> While the time spent interacting with the website was about the same in both analyses (~20mins), the amount of time required to record the analyses differed. The recording of findings from the heuristic evaluation took several hours, while the completions of the Questionnaire and Observation Form were accomplished simultaneously to the user’s interaction with the website.
<br><br>
Secondly, <u><i>each of the two types of analysis yielded a different quality of results.</i></u> The usability test allowed for interaction between the professional conducting the system analysis and the participant, yielding a two-person dialog concerning evaluative suggestions for improvement. The heuristic analysis was more systematic and covered a greater range of aspects to consider.
</p>

<p style="margin-left: 30px; margin-right: 30px;">
<b>Suggestions for improvement:</b>
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Embed a link to The Tower Archive (which includes issues 1922-2018), perhaps along the navigation bar.
</li>
  <li>Refine the aesthetics of the in-website archives list by deleting the in-page list, and re-formatting the footer archives list into multiple columns.
</li>
  <li>Improve universal usability to include a non-english-speaking audience. Perhaps embed a translation widget that allows users to translate each page.
</li>
<li>Add the title of the website into the (HTML?) code so that the website title appears in the tab of the browser.
</li>
</ul>
